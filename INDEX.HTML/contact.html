  <b><u>  <h2>PROXIMITY SENSOR:</h2></u></b>
    <p>The proximity sensor is the type of IoT sensor in which the existance and non-existence of the surrounding object are identified .After this ,this detected signal is converted into a form the user understands.</p>

    <b><u><h2>CHEMICAL SENSOR:</h2></u></b>
    <p>A chemical sensor helps in determine various kinds of change in liquid and for detecting the air chemical variation .These are mainly put to use in bigger cities and towns as it is impotant to look after the changes for providing safetly to the</p>

    <u><b><h2>GAS SENOR</h2></b></u>
    <p>Gas sensor are similar to chemical sensor but are specialy implemented for observing modification in the quanlity of air .These is done to find out .Which type of gases are present in it.This snsor is being used in multiple domins such as health manufacturing ,agriculture,for supervision of gas in coal industries etc.</p>

    <b><u><h2>HUMIDITY SENSOR:</h2></u></b>
    <p>Humidity is used for defining the vapor present in the atmosphere or in are used as temperature sensor as the manufacting operation require similar operation condition by measureing humidity .It can be ensured that the complete procedure will pass aways easily</p>

    <h2>ACCELERATION SENSOR:</h2>
    <P>An acceleration sensor is sensor is used for calculating the acceleration and angular values the accelerometer is  primilarly used for calculating acceleration .Thereare two type of forces that create an impact on the accelerometer these are static force and dynamics force.</P>

    <h2>SOUND SENSOR</h2>
    <p>Sound sensor can generally be identified as the microphone  devices that are used for delivering the corresponding level of voltage  and sound on the basis of the sound level detection by implementing the sound sensor ,a small robot may be manufacting for navigation on the basis of sound received </p>

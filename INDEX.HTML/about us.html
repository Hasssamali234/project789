    <h2>POSITION SENSOR</h2>
    <P>Postion sensor are used for the purpuose of measuring movement ,displament and position and may be rotary or linear .These are used for contorlling the throttle,measuring wind direction,positioning the ramp and bridge,simulating flights and steering angle measurment</P>

    <h2>PRESSURE SENSOR:</h2>
    <p>Pressure sensr are being used for measuring pressure and can be a differential,gauge,or abosolute.The most common type of pressure sensors that are used comprise transducers which are also known as pressure switches or pressur transmitters.</p>

    <h2>WEIGHT SENSOR:</h2>
    <p>The weight sensor are known for giving the exact weight measurement by measuring the amount of force that is being applied .the load sensors are used in counting scales,hopper scales,platform scales, tank weighing and on-bording weighting</p>

    <h2>USES OF SENSOR:</h2>
    <P>if we look around carefully ,sensor are used in many product that we use in our day-to-day life .Sensor are used in various industries comprising automotive,medical aerospace,defense and agriculture</P>
    <h2>APPLICATION OF DIGITAL SENSORS:</h2>
    <p>Digital sensors are the electrochemical sensors or electronic sensors in which the transmission and conversion of data take place digital sensors are known to have overcome the draw back present in analog sensors and have slowly begun to replace them.This control system has various advantage and provide accurates result in comparison to the anlog temperatyre cntrol system is capable of providing a temperature display and switches off when the temperature exceeds a set point.</p>

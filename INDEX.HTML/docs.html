   <u><b> <h1>SENSOR:</h1></b></u>
    <P>the sensor may be define as a machine,module,subsystem or device. Whose purpose is to detect change and event in the envioment.The information regrading theses changes is further sent to various other electronic mostly comprising of a computer procressor.A sensor is always used along with an electronic device</P>
    <h1>CLASSIFICATION OF SENSOR:</h1>
    <P>Sensor are classified on the basis of the output signal ,physical and parameter measured by them,and various other point.Sensor on the basis of the output signal are classified into analogy and digital sensor</P>
    <b><u><h2>Temperature Sensor:</h2></b></u>
    <p>Temperature is the commonly measured enviroment quantity for various reason .There are different type lof temperature sensor that are used for measuring temperature detectors,thermocouple,semiconductor temperature</p>
